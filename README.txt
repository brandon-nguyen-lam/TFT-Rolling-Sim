Based on Set 7!
Hello! This is the source code for my TFT rolling simulator!
The goal of this is to find out the odds of finding a specific unit.
This is mostly for figuring out rolling on 7 or 8 and seeing the best outcome in case you're contested.
Levels 6-9 will have the code for them but not 1-5 as there are no scenarios where they're needed.

For some general knowledge, the champion pool is as stands:
1 Cost: 29
2 Cost: 22
3 Cost: 18
4 Cost: 12
5 Cost: 10

The total amount of units per cost:
1 Cost: 13
2 Cost: 13
3 Cost: 13
4 Cost: 11
5 Cost: 8

For those who do not play TFT, each shop has 5 units in them. The champion pool means that
there are only a specific amount of that one champion per its cost. The two main factors
in determining what is inside your shop. Your level, which increases the odds of higher cost
champions appearing and the other champions in and out of the pool
